This is my third shiny app/dashboard for my second homework on PA municipal public finance data.

This Data Set was cleaned and merged using the following sources:
1. Municipal Data: [PA Department of Community & Economic Development](http://munstats.pa.gov/Reports/ReportInformation2.aspx?report=StatewideMuniAfr)
2. Municipal Names: [Census Shapefile](https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php)

To get accurate municipal names and its corresponding counties, I have to refer to census data. However, some municipalites which are under two counties will be split into two parts in the census shapefile data. Thus, some processing is needed to combine them back into one municipalities. Indicators were derived from the financial numbers of DCED.
